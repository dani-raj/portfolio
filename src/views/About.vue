       <p>
        After being a creative copywriter for 6 years, creating many campaigns for major brands, writing a lot of ads (only the ones you liked)
        and winning some awards with my colleagues, I now feel the need to look for other challenges. 
        <br><br>
        Around a year ago a friend of mine recommended me to try to learn the basics of web development. 
        I quickly learned how to make basic projects and I had so much fun doing it that I dived into it deeper.
        <br>
        A year later, with endless amounts of Youtube videos, Udemy courses and googling behind me, I built some bigger apps that you can find in this portfolio.
        <br>
        I'm focused on understaning Vue.js and I can't wait to put my knowledge into practise with real-life projects.
        <br>
        Programming feels like a game to me. Sometimes easy, sometimes challenging, but it's always satisfying to solve something and see its result.
        <br><br>
        The portfolio also includes my work from the times I was a creative and some design projects I made for fun.
        <br><br>
        Don't hesitate to contact me if you feel I would be a good fit in your team!
